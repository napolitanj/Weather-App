Weather App
-----------

LIVE DEMO: https://napolitanj.github.io/Weather-App/

A simple weather app made according to the standards set by the project in The Odin Project.

My goal with this project is to demonstrate proficiency with callbacks, API requests, and promises, as well as an understanding of asynchornous javascript.

--------------------
How to use this app:

*If the application does not load, it is likely because the API key being used hit its maximum daily requests*

The header displays current weather. The body displays a 7 day prediction.

The default location will be Chicago.

Enter a new location in the search bar and press "Go" To change the location.

Click the toggle below the current temperature to change between Fahrenheit and Celcius.

Version History


-----------
Version 1.0
-----------

The application is live! See how to use this application above. Will add styling later.

-----------
Version 0.2
-----------

Currently cannot test interface as too many API requests is blocking data, however...

The daily weather items should now render as well as refresh when the location is changed.

-----------
Version 0.1
-----------

The top banner mostly works. A user can get weather updates by searching for a city. Various changes need to be made including:

- Ability to switch between F and C.
- Formatting times so that when minutes are less than 10 they appear correct.
- Style.
- Allow search input to respond to "enter".
- Weekly forecast window.
