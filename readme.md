Weather App
-----------

A simple weather app made according to the standards set by the project in The Odin Project.

My goal with this project is to demonstrate proficiency with callbacks, API requests, and promises, as well as an understanding of asynchornous javascript.

Version 0.1

The top banner mostly works. A user can get weather updates by searching for a city. Various changes need to be made including:

- Ability to switch between F and C.
- Formatting times so that when minutes are less than 10 they appear correct.
- Style.
- Allow search input to respond to "enter".
- Weekly forecast window.
